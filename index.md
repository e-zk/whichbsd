# Which BSD Should I Use?
##### Last updated: {{ 'now' | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}

This question comes up on an almost daily basis on BSD-related IRC channels,
forums, and mailing lists.
Asking the users of each BSD will yield different opinionated answers, so here
are some basic facts about each one to let you decide which one to use.
Of course, the best way to make the decision for yourself is to just try each
one and see which you prefer.

## A Quick BSD History

## Major BSD Operating Systems

Unlike various distributions of GNU/Linux which wrap combinations of similar
software around a single Linux kernel, each modern BSD operating system is its
own separate project with its own kernel, libraries, and userland software.
While each of the projects do share code from time to time, they have largely
diverged from each other decades ago.
